# Jenkins Pipeline Fix - SonarQube Tool Issue

## Problem Identified

After analyzing the Jenkins pipeline logs, I've identified a critical issue that was causing build failures:

The pipeline was looking for a SonarQube scanner tool with name `scanner`, but the error messages indicate that SonarScanner was the actual tool name configured in your Jenkins environment.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated SonarQube Scanner Tool Reference**:
   - Changed all references from `tool name: 'scanner'` to `tool name: 'SonarScanner'` to match the correct tool name in your Jenkins configuration
   - This change was applied consistently across all modules in the pipeline

2. **Created a Clean Jenkinsfile**:
   - Created a completely updated Jenkinsfile (`jenkinsfile_updated.groovy`) with the fix
   - Copied this to replace the existing `jenkinsfile`

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Run your Jenkins pipeline with the updated Jenkinsfile
2. The SonarQube scanner should now be found correctly
3. Monitor the build logs to ensure that all modules can properly use the SonarQube scanner

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consistent Tool Naming**:
   - Ensure that tool names in Jenkins match exactly what's referenced in your Jenkinsfile
   - Consider adding comments about tool names to avoid similar issues in the future

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The pipeline already has good error handling for SonarQube analysis failures
   - This allows the build to continue even if SonarQube scanning fails

3. **Git Checkout Issues**:
   - I noticed some Git checkout errors in the logs
   - This appears to be a network/connection issue when fetching from GitHub
   - Consider adding retries for Git operations or adjusting timeout settings

## Next Steps

If you encounter any other issues with the pipeline, please let me know, and I'll help you address them. The SonarQube scanner tool naming issue should now be resolved.
