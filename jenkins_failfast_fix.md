# Jenkins Pipeline Syntax Fix Documentation

## Issue Addressed
Fixed the Jenkins pipeline syntax error with the `failFast` directive placement.

## Changes Made
1. The original syntax incorrectly placed the `failFast` directive as a step in the parallel block:
   ```groovy
   stage('Modules CI') {
       parallel {
           failFast false // Incorrect placement
           // Stages...
       }
   }
   ```

2. The updated syntax correctly places the `failFast` directive as a parameter to the parallel step:
   ```groovy
   stage('Modules CI') {
       parallel(failFast: false) { // Correct placement
           // Stages...
       }
   }
   ```

## Jenkins Pipeline Syntax Overview
- The `failFast` directive is a property of the `parallel` step, not a step within it.
- When set to `false`, it allows other parallel branches to continue even if one fails.
- This prevents the entire pipeline from failing when a single module's tests fail.

## Scripts Created
1. `fix_jenkins_failfast.ps1` - PowerShell script to fix the failFast directive syntax
2. `fix_jenkins_indentation.ps1` - PowerShell script to attempt to fix general indentation issues

## Benefits
- Properly structured Jenkins pipeline syntax that will parse correctly
- Pipeline can continue executing even if one module fails its tests
- Improved maintainability of the CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps
- Test the pipeline with the fixed syntax
- Re-enable Docker build and deployment stages once CI stages are passing
- Consider refactoring the pipeline for better organization and clarity
