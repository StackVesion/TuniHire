# Face Verification Enhancements for TuniHire

## Overview of Improvements
This document summarizes the enhancements made to the facial recognition feature in TuniHire to improve detection rates, especially for profile photos.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Image Preprocessing 
- **Added image format normalization**: Automatic conversion of RGBA to RGB for better compatibility
- **Brightness and contrast enhancement**: Preprocessing images with sub-optimal lighting to improve face detection
- **Image resizing**: Automatic resizing of large images for better performance
- **Multiple detection models**: Fallback to CNN model when HOG model fails to detect faces

### 2. Better Diagnostics and Logging
- **Image diagnostics**: Added detailed information about images (dimensions, brightness, format)
- **Enhanced logging**: More verbose logging to identify issues during verification
- **Brightness analysis**: Detection of too dark or too bright images that may cause detection failures

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **Specific error messages**: More descriptive error messages based on the actual issue
- **Better frontend feedback**: Enhanced UI error messages with helpful tips for users
- **Error categorization**: Separation of profile photo vs. verification photo issues

### 4. Testing Tools
- **Test script**: Added test_face_recognition.py to help diagnose issues with specific images
- **API testing**: Support for testing both the service directly and through the API

## Usage

### Testing Face Recognition
You can test face verification between two images using:

```bash
python test_face_recognition.py path/to/profile_image.jpg path/to/verification_image.jpg
```

### Troubleshooting
If face detection fails:
1. Check the logs for brightness issues
2. Ensure the face is clearly visible and well-lit in the image
3. Try using higher resolution images
4. Use the test script to diagnose specific image pairs

## Future Improvements
1. Add face alignment preprocessing
2. Implement gradual threshold adjustment for verification
3. Build face quality assessment to guide users during photo capture
